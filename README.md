# Analysis of Ford GoBike System Dataset
## by Ezekiel Okato


## Dataset

> The dataset contains information of  individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. There are 183412 rides and 16 features in the dataset. Wrangling has been undertaken in order for exploratory analysis to be done.

> Data source : Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data 



## Summary of Findings

> The main variable of interest in the analysis was the duration of the trips taken using Ford GoBikes System. 

> During exploration, fascinating relationships between the trip duration and other variables in the dataset were found. The trip duration was observed to have a unimodal distribution and had a median of 10 minutes. Using a heatmap to establish the relationship between trip duration and ages of members, it was noted that most of the trips were below 200 minutes and the number of trips decreased with the increase of the age of the members. An adapted barplot was then used to highlight the relationship between the trip duration and the day of the trip, it  was noticed that the average duration of trips was longer on Saturday and Sunday than on the other days of the week. From the relationships of categorical variables and trip duration, it was seen that longer trips were taken by customer users of all genders, _other_ gender and members who did not share bikes during the trip.

> Outside the main variable of interest, it was noticed that the average age of  bike users of all genders was approximately 34 years, there was a preference of not sharing rides among all gender categories, most trips were taken on Thursdays while Saturday and Sunday had the least number of trips.Furthermore, across the week, significantly more male members, subscriber users and members who did not share their bikes were taking bike trips.
